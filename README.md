This be me treasure trove of booty
## Assignments

### MSP
Despite being a children's game, hangman is a fairly graphic concept for children... Don't you think?  Regardless, it makes a pretty good python excersise.  Be sure to make your own wrong letter insults though, do your own thing.

### Quarditodiscrim
I think the quintessential engineering skill is to take hours to automate something you could easily do by hand.  We were so offended by this concept that we were sure to include insults along the way... I am detecting a trend with our assignments.
